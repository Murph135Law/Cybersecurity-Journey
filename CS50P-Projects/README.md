## What I'm Learning

This course provides the Python foundation essential for security automation and tool development:

- **Variables & Functions**: Building reusable code components
- **Control Flow**: Logic for decision-making in security scripts
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error management for production tools
- **File I/O**: Processing logs, configs, and security data
- **Regular Expressions**: Parsing and pattern matching (critical for log analysis)
- **OOP**: Structuring complex security applications
- **Testing**: Ensuring code reliability with pytest

## Why This Matters for Cybersecurity

Security analysts need Python for:
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Building custom security tools
- Processing and analyzing log files
- Integrating with security APIs
- Creating incident response scripts

CS50P provides the structured foundation to build production-quality security tools, not just scripts that "work on my machine."
