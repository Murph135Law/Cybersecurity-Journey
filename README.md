## 💼 What I Bring to SOC Work

My hospitality operations background isn't just "previous experience" - it's directly applicable to security operations:

| Hospitality Management | Security Operations Center |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 24/7 high-pressure operations (1000s of customers) | 24/7 SOC shift operations monitoring alerts |
| 10pm crisis management (kitchen fire, POS failure) | 10pm security incident response |
| Reading customer behavior patterns | Identifying attacker tactics and patterns |
| Rapid triage of multiple simultaneous problems | Alert triage and prioritization |
| Technical troubleshooting under pressure | Endpoint and network issue resolution |
| Clear communication to non-technical stakeholders | Security reporting to management |
| Team leadership across rotating shifts | SOC team collaboration |

**The pressure handling, systematic troubleshooting, and operational mindset transfer directly.**
